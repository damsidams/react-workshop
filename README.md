# React Workshop - Build a To-Do List App

## Introduction

Welcome to this **2-hour React workshop**, where we will build a simple **To-Do List App** while learning the core concepts of React. This step-by-step guide will help you understand how React works and give you hands-on experience in building a basic interactive web application.

## Step 1: Introduction to React (10 min)

### What is React?

React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building interactive user interfaces. It enables developers to create reusable UI components and manage application state efficiently.

### Why Use React?

- Component-based architecture (reusable UI parts)
- Virtual DOM for efficient updates
- One-way data flow for predictable state management
- Large community and ecosystem

### Key Concepts

- **Components**: Reusable building blocks of UI
- **JSX**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML within JavaScript
- **Props**: Pass data between components
- **State**: Manage dynamic data in components

### Task

- Research React and its advantages
- Install Node.js and npm if not installed

### Tips

- Visit [React Docs](https://react.dev) for official documentation
- Practice by reading JSX examples

## Step 2: Setting Up a React Project (20 min)

### Creating a React App with Vite

Vite is a fast build tool that allows for an optimized development experience.

### Task

1. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-todo-app --template react
```

2. Navigate into the project and install dependencies:

```bash
cd my-todo-app
